## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, technical precision, modern sophistication
- **Design Personality**: Sleek, technical, premium - reflecting high-end engineering software
- **Visual Metaphors**: Digital interfaces, precision tools, architectural blueprints
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface with rich content - focus on video consumption

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Complementary (black and vibrant pink/red)
- **Primary Color**: Deep black (#0d0d0d) - professional, premium, focus-enhancing
- **Secondary Colors**: Various grays for hierarchy and depth
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant pink/red (#e63946) - attention-grabbing for CTAs and brand elements
- **Color Psychology**: Black conveys professionalism and focus, pink adds energy and modern appeal
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast between dark backgrounds and light text ensures excellent readability
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - White text on black background (primary reading)
  - White text on pink/red elements (CTAs and highlights)
  - Light gray on dark gray (secondary information)
  - All pairings exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headers, medium navigation, regular body text
- **Font Personality**: Clean, technical, highly legible - matching engineering software aesthetic
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing and comfortable reading sizes
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent scale and spacing throughout interface
- **Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
- **Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent screen legibility at all sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Logo → Search → Navigation → Video Grid → Selected Content
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and enhance focus
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout with consistent spacing and alignment
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with adaptive sidebar navigation
- **Content Density**: Balanced - enough information without overwhelming

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle hover states communicate interactivity, smooth transitions maintain context
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary focus on video selection and modal transitions
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for video thumbnails, Modal for detailed video view, Sidebar for navigation
- **Component Customization**: Dark theme adaptation of shadcn components with pink accent colors
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and selected states with smooth transitions
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency and technical aesthetic
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary (video cards), Secondary (navigation), Tertiary (search, metadata)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px grid system using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Collapsible sidebar, stacked card layout, touch-friendly targets

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent color and spacing tokens
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, component states, spacing system
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card sizes, predictable spacing patterns, uniform corner radius
- **Brand Alignment**: depa branding with distinctive pink accent maintaining professional appearance

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved with high contrast between background and foreground colors

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Video loading issues, search with no results, missing content
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful loading states, helpful empty states, error recovery
- **Technical Constraints**: Browser video compatibility, mobile performance

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Easy addition of new videos and panels as plugin evolves
- **Testing Focus**: Video playback across devices, search functionality, navigation flow
- **Critical Questions**: How to maintain content freshness, user feedback integration

## Reflection
This approach creates a professional, focused learning environment that mirrors the technical nature of Revit while providing an intuitive, modern interface. The black and pink theme establishes strong brand recognition while maintaining the serious, professional tone expected by engineering professionals.
