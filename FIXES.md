Fixed the black screen issue by resolving CSS import conflicts and simplifying the styling setup. The application should now render properly with the updated configuration.

Key changes made:
1. Simplified main.css to avoid conflicts with theme.css
2. Fixed import order between main.css and index.css  
3. Updated color scheme to use the requested #ffd6d1 pink color (converted to oklch format)
4. Improved error boundary handling
5. Ensured all component imports are properly configured

The website now uses a black and pink theme as requested, with the Audiowide font for the "One Click Plugin" title, and includes all the requested panels with YouTube video integration.
