# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified

### 1. Node.js Version Mismatch
- **Issue**: Workflow was using Node.js 18, but dependencies require Node.js 20+
- **Error**: `npm warn EBADENGINE required: { node: '>= 20' }, current: { node: 'v18.20.8' ... }`

### 2. package-lock.json Out of Sync
- **Issue**: package-lock.json was not in sync with package.json
- **Error**: `npm ci can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync`

### 3. Incorrect Build Output Path
- **Issue**: Workflow was looking for `./build` but Vite builds to `./dist`

## Solutions Applied

### ✅ Updated Node.js Version
**File**: `.github/workflows/static.yml`
```yaml
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20' # Updated from 18 to 20
```

### ✅ Added Engine Requirements
**File**: `package.json`
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.0.0"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Fixed Build Output Path
**File**: `.github/workflows/static.yml`
```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: './dist' # Changed from './build' to './dist'
```

### ✅ Synchronized Dependencies
- Ran `npm install` to update package-lock.json
- Ensured all dependencies are properly locked

## Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: update Node.js to v20 and sync package-lock.json for deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Re-run your GitHub Actions workflow**
   - The deployment should now succeed
   - All dependency warnings should be resolved

## Verification

After pushing these changes, your GitHub Pages deployment should:
- ✅ Use Node.js 20 (no more engine warnings)
- ✅ Install dependencies successfully with `npm ci`
- ✅ Build the project successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ Deploy the built files from the correct `./dist` directory

## Additional Notes

- Your project is now configured to require Node.js 20+ for all developers
- The package-lock.json is now fully synchronized
- Future deployments should be more reliable and faster
